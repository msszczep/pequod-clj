# pequod-clj

A Clojure rewrite of the Pequod library, which simulates the participatory planning procedure of a non-market, non-command-planning, democratically planned participatory economy (parecon, or PEX).

Documentation for the rationale of the library and some of its details, as originally articulated, appear in the `docs` directory of this repository.

Most of the functionality of this repository has been ported into the [pequod-cljs library](https://github.com/msszczep/pequod-cljs).  Refer to that app for further development.
