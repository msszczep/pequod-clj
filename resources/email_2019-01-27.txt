Hi Mitchell

After reviewing the code I think you are correct. The functions you identified (produce-input-goods and produce-final-goods) are deprecated, and have been replaced by the produce-N functions in the script-generated solutionN.nls files. The function called assign-new-proposal formats the generated solutions for use by the rest of the model. The actual solutions in the new code are distinguished by the number of input-goods, and not by the classification as input-goods or final-goods as in the old code.
